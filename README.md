# Promys
_Project My Screen_

http://promys.me

A screencasting system project based on a Pi 3. Nothing very new for such project except that it aims at being very user friendly. Easy setup for users on Windows, Mac and Linux.

User connects to the Promys Device Wifi access point, visits the embedded web page, downloads client application from there and starts it. Almost as easy as Click&Share from BARCO but at a reasonable price (~40â‚¬).

It's **NOT** like a Chromecast device, guests don't have to join hosts wifi network. It's suitable for companies that would like to offer easy screencasting to visitors and employees. It's more similar to Click&Share. I don't see a point using it at home, but, why not?

Already made image is available on the web site (see below), so it should be very straightforward to setup a Pi3 out of the box and have an up and running system.

For the moment it is very basic but it can be extended with plenty of nifty features. Check out TODO/Ideas section for that and feel free to contribute.

## Background

What this is all about...

I've seen those BARCO boxes that let you screencast your desktop onto a TV set or projector a lot. Very handy, but as usual no Linux binary (there used to be one but not maintained anymore for lame reasons) and also very expensive.
There are blogs and blablas about how to do screencasting, but most of the time instructions are awkward and based on complicated ffmpeg or VLC setup, well nothing very user friendly.
Knowing RPi3 hardware capabilities, espcecially the H264 decoder and the Wifi addon I just put myself into the challenge to deliver an easy to use or setup system. Building a Promys device is easy and cheap, using it is easy as well. It can improve in many ways. Dig in and join!

## Building a Promys device

Just want to build a `Promys device` and use it ?

1. First get a Raspberry Pi 3 (I haven't tested with Pi 2 but you'll miss the main advantage of Wifi).
2. ~~Find **[here](http://promys.me/downloads/image_2018-02-02-Promys.zip)** a zipped image for a 2GB or more SD card~~ **Current image needs a fix, lighttpd doesn start, fix soon**
3. Unzip the file, you should get an approximately 1.6Gb image.
4. Insert the SD card in your system, and figure out what device it is bound to. This is very important so you don't screw up with following command. If you have a SD card reader slot it's likely to be `/dev/mmcblk0`
5. Finally burn the SD with :
```
dd if=2018-02-02-Promys.img of=/dev/xxxxx bs=4M
```
6. Insert the SD in the Raspberry, connect to a projector or TV with HDMI cable. Power TV on.
7. Power on the Promys device.
8. Tada ![Splash](/Server/Target/opt/promys/splash.jpg)

> **Warning**, you won't be able to login to the device. You'll need to modify the image by mounting the SD and remove start up lines in `/etc/rc.local` file

> **Note:** There is a nice [documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) from Raspberry's web site that covers instructions on how to burn SD card for major operating systems.

## Server
This section describes what is needed to build and setup the server.

### _Binary_
You'll need a Pi3 running `Raspian stretch` to compile the server executable. I don't cover any cross-compiling instructions.

If you've installed a Raspbian disto you'll only need `libjpeg62-turbo-dev` package.

Just get to `Server` directory and type make. It relies on `/op/vc` package that contains helper libraries to use the OpenMAX layer available for the Broadcom ARM chip.

### _Server setup_

`Server/Target` directory contains a few things to modify on the system to make it dedicated.

* `boot` directory contains suggested modified `cmdline.txt` and `config.txt` files.
* `/etc/rc.local` should be replaced with the one proposed.
* Making the device a Wifi access point and adjusting various networking things relies on `/etc` content.
* Embedded web site is also setup in `www`, you'll need to install `lighttpd` package to serve it. You'll need to install client binaries in `downloads` sub-directory.
* application directory is `/opt/promys` with splash screen image.
* I also made mounted filesystems `readonly` to avoid the annoying usual SD issues.

Section below points to how to create an image for dedicated Promys box. You should find insteresting things there.

### _Creating an image_

I've forked `pi-gen` project and modified it to generate a Promys image. Check out https://github.com/OliverSwift/pi-gen
It still needs a lot of clean up to get the bare necessities, but it's a start.

## Client
The client part is the application to be run on a desktop so as to cast it to a Promys device connected to a TV set or projector.
Once launched it will start searching promys device over available networks. When a promys device is found your desktop will be cast to it.
A desktop PC or Mac can be directly connected to a Promys device using its Wifi access point or the same lan network they both are connected to. Usually, Wifi is used for guests and Lan for co-workers in a company. Lan connection is optional since it might be not allowed by company's security policy (default Promys device behaviour it to NAT Wifi trafic to Lan).

You'll need native 64bit platforms running (or VMs). I used Ubuntu 16.04, Windows 7, MacOS High Sierra.
Minimum environment is required for compiling client binaries. You'll need bash, git, gcc (or clang) and nasm 2.13.
On Windows `cygwin64` is required with these specific packages. On Linux you'll probably have to get recent nasm package. On MacOS you'll need XCode and nasm.

It depends on x264 and ffmpeg package. It only uses libswscale/libavutil from ffmpeg, x264 is used for video compression.
For each platform you'll have to compile them this way:

In `Client/Common` directory you'll have to clone both projects.
```
# cd Client/Common
# git clone http://git.videolan.org/git/x264.git x264
# git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg
```
Current promys clients have been compiled against these exact versions:
```
x264: b00bcafe53a166b63a179a2f41470cd13b59f927
ffmpeg: bfe397e4313c640e2f05c90a2ff1541f50524094
```
For versions matching reason I recommend to git checkout these commits.

**Important:** For compiling `x264` you'll need nasm version 2.13 or superior.

| Build OS | NASM 2.13 source |
|----------|------------------|
| Ubuntu/Debian | https://debian.pkgs.org/sid/debian-main-amd64/nasm_2.13.02-0.1_amd64.deb.html |
| MacOS | http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.13.01/macosx/nasm-2.13.01-macosx.zip |
| Windows | Add nasm in package selection when installing `cygwin64` https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe |

Compile `x264`:
```
# ./configure --disable-cli --enable-shared
# make
```

Compile `ffmpeg`:
```
# ./configure --disable-all --enable-swscale --enable-shared
# make
```

For both, no installation step needed. Leave libs where they are.

Once you have x264, swscale and avtuil libraries compiled you can proceed to each specific build stages below.

### Windows

Get to `Client/Windows` and type `make install`. This will generate a `promys.exe` file which is
a autoextractable executable with all needed stuff in it. User has just to run it, no installer, automatic clean-up.

### Linux

Get to `Client/Linux` and type `make package`. This will generate a `promys.deb` file which is
intended for debian based distros. User will have to install it prior to using the client.
With any launcher, search for promys and start the application.

### MacOS

Get to `Client/MacOS` and type `make`. This will generate a `promys.dmg` file which is
a software drive. User will have to download it, open it and start the application. GateKeeper
will certainly ask permission to run an application downloaded from the Internet.
The already built one is signed with my developer account so user won't have to allow its execution.
I haven't pushed it on the Mac Store though.

## TODO
_and ideas_
* version checking
* overscan adjustment with CEC
* connect a smartphone and fake a laser spot
* improve clients (performance, power consumption, mouse capture, ...)
* token passing for presenters (queuing for screencasting)
* administration web page (Wifi ESSID, password, enable/disable NAT feature, IP addresses, overscan, etc)
* ...
