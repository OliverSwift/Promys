_Project My Screen_

A screencasting system project based on a Pi 3. Nothing very new for such project except that it aims at being very user friendly. Easy setup for users on Windows, Mac and Linux.

User connects to Wifi, visits an embedded wb page, downloads and starts client application. Almost as easy as Click&Share from BARCO but at a reasonable price (~40â‚¬).

Already made image will be available soon on the web site, so it should be very straightforward to setup a Pi3 out of the box and have an up and running system.

For the moment it is very basic but it can be extended with plenty of nifty features. Check out TODO/Ideas section for that and feel free to contribute.

## Clients
All clients depends on x264 and ffmpeg package. It only uses libswscale/libavutil from ffmpeg, x264 it used for video compression.
In `Client/Common` directory you'll have to clone both projects.
